President and Owner of Onyx Imperium LLC

Job Roles: Systems administrator, Cybersecurity Engineer, Blockchain Engineer, Automation Engineer, DevSecOps Developer, Cybersecurity Analyst, Financial Advisor

I have worked in a professional capacity in both the fields of finance and technology. As a technologists I have many interests in many technical fields that intersect with finance as both finance and technology are two of my favorite passions. Hence the reason that my doctoral program is a combination of both business and technology. Fintech is an emerging field of study, however I have been familiar with this field since first learning about Bitcoin back in my undergraduate years at university.

Buy the dip! This is the way!
